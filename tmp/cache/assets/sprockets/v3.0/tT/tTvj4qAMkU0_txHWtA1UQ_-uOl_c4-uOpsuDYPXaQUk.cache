  <p>Dear Advisors and Delegates, &nbsp;<p>
<p>
  <p>It is with great pride that I formally invite you to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology‚Äôs Model United Nations Tenth Conference!</p>
  <p>MITMUNC is a premier Model UN conference in which students from all over the world come together to solve the most pressing issues facing society today. This year‚Äôs conference will be held at MIT‚Äôs internationally-recognized campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts during the weekend of Friday, February 9th through Sunday, February 11th, 2018. Registration will open this Friday, September 22nd, 2017. </p>
  <p>
  At its core, MITMUNC is planned, organized, and directed in its totality by a passionate team of MIT students that bring together a diversity of academic backgrounds and experiences to the dais. Our chairs and staff coordinate MITMUNC‚Äôs committees from the ground up, bringing committee sessions that even the most experienced delegates will find challenging. Our dedicated Secretariat members complement the chairs and staff by overseeing all conference preparations, months in advance before delegates arrive to Cambridge in order to ensure our number one priority is satisfied-our delegates‚Äô having a rewarding experience.
  </p>
  <p>Last year, MITMUNC delegates deliberated upon complicated humanitarian topics such as the Syrian Refugee crisis, argued the pros and cons of nuclear energy in the International Atomic Energy Agency, and even reacted to a simulated hostage situation witnessed by members of the International Court of Justice. Attendees also enjoyed an inspiring keynote address by Bengt Holmstr√∂m, the most recent winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics as well as renowed economist and M.I.T. professor Esther Duflo, Co-Founder and Director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab.

</p>
  <p>Although last year MITMUNC expanded with the addition of a 14th committee in the form of the UN Commission for Latin America & the Caribbean and ‚Äãwe had ‚Äãour highest number of registrants recorded, we pride ourselves in retaining relatively small committee sizes, when compared to other Model UN conferences. This allows our attendees more aperture to contribute and distinguish themselves in their individual committee sessions. MITMUNC offers its attendees a truly unique opportunity to immerse themselves in a demanding intellectual environment, exposed to the ideas of others and tasked to employ the art of negotiation to pass meaningful resolutions.
</p>
  <p>Having experienced as a Secretariat member, chair of our recently-launched MITMUNC China, and now as Secretary-General, I am both humbled and thrilled to guide the special 10th anniversary edition of our conference, celebrating a decade of excellence. I now invite you to explore our new website to learn more about our conference. Do not hesitate in contacting us should you encounter any doubts along the way.
  </p>
</p>
<p>Sincerely,</br></br>
