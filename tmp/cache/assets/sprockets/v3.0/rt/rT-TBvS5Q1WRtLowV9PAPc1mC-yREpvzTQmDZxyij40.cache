  <p>Dear Advisors and Delegates, &nbsp;<p>
<p>
  <p>Thank you for making MITMUNC IX 2017 a truly great endeavor!</p>
  <p>During Friday, February 10th through Sunday, February 12th, 2017, hundreds of delegates from the United States, China, Canada, Colombia, India, Oman, South Korea, and other represented countries and territories convened together for a challenging weekend of fruitful discussion and diplomacy.</p>
  <p>
  Our conference opened up with inspirational remarks about tackling world poverty from renowed economist and M.I.T. professor <strong>Esther Duflo</strong>, Co-Founder and Director of the <strong>Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab</strong>. <strong>Caitlin Moore of the UN Association of Greater Boston</strong> then shared advice on how to extend the impact of Model United Nations outside the classroom. Finally, <strong>Bengt Holmstr√∂m</strong>, this year's winner of the <strong>Nobel Prize in Economics</strong> and M.I.T. professor, closed the opening ceremonies with insight into his career, highlighting the importance of research across national borders.
  <p>Throughout MITMUNC IX, dozens of resolutions were debated upon, attempting to solve real world problems such as mitigating the effects of<strong>climate change and promoting biodiversity, delivering healthcare to war-torn populations in Aleppo, Syria, and even rebalancing international policy at the wake of the United Kingdom's proposed exodus from the European Union. </strong></p>
  <p>I am very proud of the entire MITMUNC Secretariat, chairs, and staff for their continued commitment to our conference's mission. I am also impressed at the quality of debate and caliber of prepation from delegates stemming from all of our fourteen committees and special cabinets. We had a record amount of over 600 delegates this year registered in attendance paired with the addition of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America committee. </p>
  <p>Due to MITMUNC's continued success, I am very humbled in announcing <strong>MITMUNC China!</strong>. We will be launching our first conference outside of the United States in <strong>Shanghai</strong> this summer, with our co-host, ASDAN China. I invite you to learn more about this exciting new endeavor by <strong>clicking on the 'MITMUNC China' tab above</strong>.</p>
  <p>If you cannot join us in Shanghai this summer, we will be hosting our annual homegrown conference at our campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts in early February. <strong>MITMUNC X 2018</strong> will be the special tenth anniversary of our conference and will build upon a decade-worth history of excellence. <strong>Preliminary conference details are now available.</strong> I invite you to explore our website to become oriented with our conference before further registration details become available. </p>
</p>
<p>Sincerely,</br></br>
