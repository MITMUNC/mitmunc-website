      <p>MITMUNC is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s premier Model United Nations conference for high school students. In early February, <strong>over 600 high school students from different corners of the globe</strong> will come together at MIT’s internationally recognized campus to participate in MITMUNC. Over the course of three days, delegates will debate upon popular topics, such as the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union to more recent topics, such as the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo, Syria. A group of passionate and driven MIT undergraduate students will direct the committee sessions, guiding debate of the world’s most demanding issues.</p>
      <p><strong>MITMUNC is an excellent medium for you to promote your brand to both high school and MIT students, along with the faculty advisors that accompany students </strong> throughout the conference. To best fit your need and interests, we have designed different sponsorship packages for your organization. If you decide to sponsor us and our mission of promoting education through the power of international relations and debate, please contact our Director of Business to discuss options.</p>
      <p>We now invite to go through our sponsorship brochure to get better oriented with our options. We look forward to continuing the conversation!</p>
