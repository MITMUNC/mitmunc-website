<p>Dear delegates and advisors,</p>
<p>Registration for MITMUNC China 2020 is now open! We cordially invite high school students of all backgrounds and 
nationalities to join us in debate about topics ranging from COVID19 recovery to human rights</p>
<p>MITMUNC China, the first international branch of MITMUNC, is in its fourth year. Normally held in the 
beautiful city of Shanghai every August, we are adapting to unprecendented times by bringing a virtual
conference to you. By doing so, we hope to emphasize accessibility for delegates from all backgrounds and 
experience levels.</p>
<p>This year's conference will be held Friday, August 14th to Sunday, August 16th, 2020 (China Standard Time). 
Registration fees are US$136, payable to our partner organization ASDAN. Very generous <strong>financial aid is available</strong> 
through a MITMUNC scholarship with a simple application process (please email secretariat-mitmunc@mit.edu if interested). 
We highly encourage everyone to apply, and look forward to meeting you all in August!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
  Ting Li and Sarah Quraishi<br>
