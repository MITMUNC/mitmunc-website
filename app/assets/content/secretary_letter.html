<p>Dear Distinguished Students and Faculty Advisors,</p>
<p>It is our utmost pleasure and distinct privilege to cordially invite you to apply for the 11th annual edition of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Model United Nations Conference (MITMUNC XI). The conference will be held from Friday, February 8th, to Sunday, February 10th, 2019 on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>During the tenth session of MITMUNC last year, we saw delegates hard at work in discussion and resolution passing, whether it be attempting to resolve the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico after the wake of Hurricane María, debating Non-Proliferation Treaty Renegotiation in the International Atomic Energy Agency, or having Neil Degrasse Tyson talk about North Korea’s nuclear attack on Pluto in the Futuristic committee. Last year's awards are linked <a href="/MITMUNC_X/MITMUNC_X-Awards.pdf">here</a>. As your Co Secretaries-General for MITMUNC XI, we look forward to seeing the same high caliber of delegates that were present last year and in previous years.</p>
<p>We hope to see you at MIT in February! In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions you may have.</p>
<p>Sincerely Yours,</p>
<p>Madeline Zhang and Karunya Sethuraman<br />
  Co Secretaries-General<br />
  MIT Model United Nations Conference XI</p>
