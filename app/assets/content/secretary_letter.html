<p>Dear delegates and advisors,</p>
<p>It is with great pride and excitement that we formally invite you to the
  Massachusetts Institute of Technology&rsquo;s 12<sup>th</sup> annual Model
  United Nations Conference!</p>
<p>MITMUNC is a premier Model UN conference in which students from all over the
  world come together to solve the most pressing issues facing society today.
  This year&rsquo;s conference will be held at MIT&rsquo;s internationally
  renowned campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts during the weekend of
  <strong>Friday, February 7<sup>th</sup> through Sunday, February
  9<sup>th</sup>, 2020</strong>.</p>
<p>At its core, MITMUNC is planned, organized, and directed by a passionate and
  ambitious team of MIT students that collectively form a diverse family of
  academic backgrounds and experiences. Our chairs and staff coordinate
  MITMUNC&rsquo;s committees from the ground up, posing questions and
  controversies that even the most experienced delegates will find challenging.
  Our dedicated Secretariat members complement the chairs and staff by
  overseeing all conference preparations, months in advance of delegates&rsquo;
  arrival to Cambridge in order to ensure that our delegates walk away with one
  of the greatest experiences of their lives.</p>
<p>Last year, MITMUNC delegates grappled with complicated human rights,
  economic, and environmental topics such as the Syrian Refugee crisis, argued
  the pros and cons of nuclear energy in the International Atomic Energy
  Agency, and even reacted to a flurry of assassinations witnessed in the
  Historical Committee! Attendees also enjoyed inspiring keynote addresses by
  Karen Dynan, Professor of the Practice in the Harvard University Department of
  Economics as well as Richard B. Freeman, Faculty co-Director of the Labor and
  Worklife Program at the Harvard Law School. Delegates also enjoyed a
  well-deserved respite at the Delegate Dance social night.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves in hosting relatively smaller committee sizes, when
  compared to other Model UN conferences. This allows our attendees more freedom
  to contribute and distinguish themselves in their individual committee
  sessions. MITMUNC offers its attendees a truly unique opportunity to immerse
  themselves in a demanding intellectual environment, exposed to the ideas of
  others and tasked to employ the art of negotiation to pass meaningful
  resolutions.</p>
<p>Having experienced MITMUNC as chairs, then as Secretariat members and
  Secretaries-General, we are both humbled and thrilled to guide MITMUNC into
  its best conference yet. I now invite you to explore our brand new website to
  learn more about our conference. Do not hesitate in contacting us should you
  encounter any doubts along the way. Best of luck in the path ahead!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
  Karunya Sethuraman and Octavio Vega<br>
  Secretaries-General<br>
  MIT Model United Nations Conference XII 2020</p>
