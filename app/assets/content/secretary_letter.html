<p>Dear Distinguished Delegates and Faculty Advisors,</p>
<p>Thank you for attending the special decade anniversary session of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Model United Nations Conference! The Secretariat, staff, chairs, and I hope that you enjoyed this year's session. Whether it be attempting to resolve the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico after the wake of Hurricane María, debating Non-Proliferation Treaty Renegotiation in the International Atomic Energy Agency, or having Neil Degrasse Tyson talk about North Korea’s nuclear attack on Pluto in the Futuristic committee, I am very proud of all the hard work you have put in passing resolutions and directives in both simulated and real crises.</p>
<p>You may find a list of conference awards linked <a href="/mitmunc_x_awards.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>It has been my honor and pleasure to serve as your Secretary General, and on behalf of the Secretariat, chairs, and other MITMUNC X staff, I'd like to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your support. We hope that you will consider applying to MITMUNC XI, to be held in February 2019! If you are in China this summer, consider attending MITMUNC China! In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions you may have.</p>
<p>Sincerely Yours,</p>
<p>Madeline Zhang<br />
  Secretary General<br />
  MIT Model United Nations Conference X<br /></p>
