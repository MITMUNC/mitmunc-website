<p>Dear Distinguished Advisors and Delegates,</p>
<p>Thank you for attending the eleventh session of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Model United Nations Conference! The Secretariat, staff, chairs, and I hope that you enjoyed this year&rsquo;s session.</p>
<p>Whether it be handling multiple assassinations in the Historical committee, funding the border wall in the IMF, or creating a resolution called &ldquo;Snoop Dogg&rdquo; in SPECPOL, I am very proud of all the hard work you have put in passing resolutions and directives in both simulated and real crises.</p>
<p>You may find a list of conference awards linked <a href="/MITMUNC_XI/MITMUNC_XI-Awards.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>It has been my honor and pleasure to serve as your Secretary-General, and on behalf of the Secretariat, chairs, and other MITMUNC XI staff, I&rsquo;d like to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your support. We hope that you will consider applying to MITMUNC XII, to be held in February 2020! If you are in China this summer, please consider attending MITMUNC China. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions you may have.</p>
<p>Sincerely Yours,<br>
